## About Me

I am a French computer science student graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a major in Machine Learning. I like to work on abstract topics such as applied mathematics, machine learning and algorithms. I have always loved building things, and computer science allows me to do so with as little physical constraint as possible, making it very exciting. I strongly believe that working in team is the best way to make a project successful.


My favorite technologies range from Python and C++ to Bash and LaTex, passing by library such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. However, at the end the technologies are always changing and so learning new things is what make me move forward.


I am passionate about making thing that look intelligent. Robotic and Machine Learning are then my two favorites fields. Diving into the data, thinking about edges cases are among what is driving me and make happy to go to work.
